  <h1 class="headercenter">What To Do If You Have Been Banned From a Sub</h1>
  <h2 class="headercenter">If you have been banned by a subreddit that OnlyPost posts to, then please follow the instructions below to remedy the situation and get OnlyPost back up and running. See the image below step 8 to see what your email should look like before sending it.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open up your email</li>
      <li>Start a new email draft</li>
      <li>Put our email address into the 'To:' field.</li>
      <li>Put "I Got Banned" in the subject field.</li>
      <li>Write in the email what sub you got banned from. Write something simple like "I was banned from r/thissubreddit"</li>
      <li>Double click the blue OnlyPost folder on your desktop to open it and see the files inside.</li>
      <li>Drag and drop the file titled "subs.py" into the bottom of the email you have open and are about to send us.</li>
      <li>Send the email and we will get back to you with a new subs.py file within 48 hours.</li>
      <br>
      <br>

    </ol> 

    <h2 class="headercenter">Once You Get an Email Back From Us</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open up the blue OnlyPost folder on your desktop.</li>
        <li>Drag the subs.py file that is currently in your OnlyPost folder and drop it into the trash.</li>
        <li>Drag the new subs.py file at the bottom of the email we sent you onto your desktop.</li>
        <li>Drag the new sub.py file that is now on your desktop and drop it in the blue OnlyPost folder.</li>
        <li>Thats it! You're all done and you can resume using OnlyPost to post to Reddit.</li>
      </ol>
